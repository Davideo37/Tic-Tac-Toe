* Assignment 2: Tic Tac Toe board 
This assignment was kinda fun to fool around with, setting the table and figuring out how to manipulate the CSS to center and style the "board". Was pretty simple
and hopefully will be expanded on in future assignments.

* Assignment 3: Working Tic Tac Toe Game
This assignment was surprisingly challenging to overcome as I was not very familiar with using JS and HTML combined. It took a lot of trial and error (and W3 schools) to figure out the nuances, plus some assistance from my fellow student Amos Cha. I am happy with the result however.

* Assignment 8: Adding Accessibility Functionality
This assignment was pretty straightforward actually. It only took adding a few lines of code to my JS, and then adding a tabindex to my board tiles so they could be navigated with tabs.
